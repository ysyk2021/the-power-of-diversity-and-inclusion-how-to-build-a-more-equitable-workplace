Providing relevant and timely information can help ensure that employees are receiving the information they need when they need it. This can involve providing targeted information through internal communications channels or offering customized training and development opportunities.

Offering Bite-Sized Learning Opportunities

Offering bite-sized learning opportunities can help prevent employees from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information they need to learn. This can involve offering short training videos or microlearning modules that provide targeted information on specific topics related to diversity and inclusion.

Encouraging Feedback and Input

Encouraging feedback and input can help ensure that employees feel heard and valued in the workplace.
